  Young Gambling in Our Society
</h1>
<article style="width: 1400px;">
<p style="width: 900px;">
  Every day in our modern society, children are being encouraged to gamble
  in video games. This is encouraged through things such as loot boxes and
  loot crates, which are virtual boxes that people can buy, that can contain
  different items worth different values, for example, somebody could buy a $2
  case, with the possibility of getting a $0.05 item in return, or a $100 item.

<p style="width: 1300px;">In games such as Fortnite and CS:GO. Children are encouraged to
spend their parent's money to buy loot boxes, in the hopes of getting
rare and expensive items that they can sell for a lot of money. In reality
though, people mostly get items worth less than the cost of the
case, encouraging the children to buy another case to make their money back.</p>

  This Problem has existed in many forms since the 1860s, the most prevelant
  form of this issue, use to be trading cards, such as baseball cards, where
  kids were encouraged to buy sets of cards, in the hopes of getting a rare
  card which they could sell for more money. Or trade for more cards.

  Nowadays, these trading cards have been replaced with loot boxes and loot
  crates as the new generations' online form of gambling. This type of
  online gambling is hard to control, as children are able to purchase
  loot boxes without the knowledge of their family or parents.
