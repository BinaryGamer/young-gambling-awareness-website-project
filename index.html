<h1>
  Young Gambling in Our Society
</h1>
<p>
  Every day in our modern society, children are being to encouraged to gamble
  in video games. This is encouraged through things such as loot boxes and
  loot crates, in games such as Fortnite and CS:GO. Children are encouraged to
  spend their parent's money to buy loot boxes, in the hopes of getting
  rare and expensive items that they can sell for a lot of money. In reality
  though, most of the time, people get items worth less than the cost of the
  case, encouraging the children to buy another case to make their money back.
