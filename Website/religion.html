<p>With christianity, there is no direct passage from the
bible, that indicates that gambling is a sin. However, many christian groups
believe that gambling is a sin, on account of that fact, that gambling is
motivated by greed, which is infact a sin.</p>

<p>Christians also believe that gambling shows a lack of love for the gambler's
neighbor, as many officals build casinos in places that they will tempt the
most amount of people. If these officials showed love for their neighbors,
they would not be attempting to swindle away their money.</p>

<p>Proverbs 15:27 says "A greedy man brings trouble to his family". This is a
common line of scripture, used as a reason to why gambling is a sin, as it is
clear that gambling is an action of greed. This proverb is normally used when
referring to the spending of family funds on gambling.</p>
